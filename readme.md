# Meteor Sample App

This is a sample bootstrap app I made in Visual Studio Code on a Mac.

It uses:

- Meteor 1.1.x
- CoffeeScript
- TypeScript
- Babel.js for ES6+
- Bootstrap 3
- AccountsTemplates
- SCSS and Less

## Setup

Run `setup.sh` to setup your environment.  
The `.gitignore` ignores the `.meteor` directory. Make your own then remove the line.

## Conclusion

Meteor 1.x+ is awesome. I may update this when I experiment or learn more.
